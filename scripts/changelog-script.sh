# This script uses github_changelog_generator to generate a changelog and requires:
#
# 1. set an env GITHUB_TOKEN for the Github token
# 2. previous release as an arg, to generate changelog since the mentioned release
# 3. github_changelog_generator be installed where the script is being executed
#
# A CHANGELOG.md is generated and it's contents can be copy-pasted on the Github release

#TODO: Since issue tracking happens in devfile/api, github_changelog_generator cannot
# detect the issues from a different repository. Need to check if this is achievable.
